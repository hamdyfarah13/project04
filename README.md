# Inhabitent
Is a project assigned by Red Academy.  In it we focused on using php as well as multiple methods in WordPress.

# What is Inhabitent?
Inhabitent is a store that sells camping supplies and blogs about camping.  

You can use the site to browse hipster camping items or read gibberish that would be blogs about camping, were this a real site.  Checkout the find us page to find the store, read about the store in the about page, browse the archives for interesting stories or peruse the shop page for needed lumber-sexual articles of clothing, tools, camping supplies, etc.
